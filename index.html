              I'm a cryptography researcher and engineer with 15 years of
              experience in software engineering and smart (IC) cards. I worked
              as a developer, researcher, and architect on various chip card and
              enterprise projects, including identification, payment, public key
              infrastructure, blockchain, and mobile solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              My interests are blockchain, cryptocurrency, and cryptography.
              Currently, I'm working on crypto wallet challenges, mobile
              authentication, and payment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like all other software engineers, I have experience with several
              programming languages and platforms. Currently, I code in
              JavaScript/TypeScript, NodeJS, React, ReactNative, NoSQL, and
              Firebase combinations for database, server, mobile, and IC chip
              programming.

          ><br />
          <p>
            Gozar is a multi-factor authentication solution on mobile phones. It
            can be used as the second-factor or the second and third factor or
            password-less biometric authentication. There are other solutions in
            the market, but Gozar is different. Gozar does not use one-time
            passwords (OTP) like others. It uses asynchronous cryptography known
            as public key/private key and digital signature and employs the
            smartphone's secure element, a cryptography chip, to store keys and
            perform cryptographic operations. Gozar combines the secure element
            with biometric verification to authenticate users. In addition,
            Gozar provides a feature called "blind authentication," which does
            not send the usernames outside of the customer system. So, Gozar
            authenticates a user while does not know the username at all. I
            developed the Android and iOS of this product using ReactNative. I
            love serverless architecture, so Gozar is developed in NodeJS and
            served by Google Firebase and NoSQL database. The dashboard is a
            React project.

          <p>
            Slap.n.Pay is a new way to shop online and pay securely and easily.
            Slap.n.Pay transforms your smartphone to a personal mobile PoS
            (Point-of-Sale) in your hand. You do not need to enter your credit
            card number, CVV, and billing address on online websites anymore.
            Just press the Slap.n.Pay button on the supported online website and
            pay on your smartphone by tapping your card to your phone.
            Slap.n.Pay uses NFC technology on your smartphone and credit card to
            create a convenient way for hassle-free payment. I developed this
            project with serverless architecture. We created a startup company
            to raise funds or establish a partnership with a well-known payment
            company. We also filed a family of patents for this product.

          <a href="https://xebawallet.com/" target="_blank"
            ><strong>XebaWallet</strong></a
          ><br />
          <p>
            It is a new secure hardware crypto wallet that supports
            cryptographic backup and super-wallet/sub-wallet. It was initially
            my Ph.D. project for 4 years, and you can find its published papers
            in the publication section. Then, I made it a product and started to
            create a startup company. I developed the cryptography code for
            smart (IC) chips using JavaCard technologies. Actually, I wrote
            micro-controller codes in a Java-like language and compiled them to
            run on Java Card Runtime Environment (JCRE). I did it on simulation
            and several real chips from various manufactures. In this project, I
            also used ePaper technology as a secure, trusted display on the
            card. I used ReactNative to create the Android and iOS apps and my
            crafted native codes for the cryptography part. XebaWallet uses the
            smartphone NFC antenna to communicate with a smart (IC) chip on a
            credit card for cryptography. The backup procedure of this project
            is new and unique. You clone a hardware wallet to another hardware
            wallet with a crafted cryptography protocol, and no hacker can
            intercept it. It is very secure and user-friendly since the user
            does not need a complex paper backup with many words and potential
            risks to expose.

          <p>
            HyperReader is a new way to use smart cards anytime and anywhere. It
            transforms the smartphone into an NFC card reader to use ISO/IEC
            7816 and 14443 compatible chips. So, a company can use HyperReader
            to read smart cards like credit cards, ID cards, or travel documents
            remotely. I developed this product using ReactNative and my native
            modules to communicate with the NFC antenna and perform
            cryptographic operations. It provides APIs that a customer uses to
            run smart (IC) card commands remotely. It gets a JavaScript-like
            code and runs it as a smart card script on the user's mobile phone!
            If you know the smart card industry, you know there are a lot of
            applications for it. ;-)

          <a href="https://github.com/hosseinpro/smartcardPage" target="_blank"
            ><strong>SmartcardPage</strong></a
          ><br />
          <p>
            This is a tool to connect web pages to smart cards via javascript.
            This tool works with all ISO7816/14443 and NFC smart cards.
            smartcardPage is a demo page to demonstrate how to use
            smartcardBridge. With this utility, you can send APDU commands and
            receive APDU responses to/from all ISO7816/14443 and NFC smart
            cards. It also supports jCardSim as a java card simulator with a
            simple REST server. You may use smartcardBridge to share smart cards
            between different virtual machines (VM) and share a smart card on a
            network. Since developing a smart (IC) card program is challenging
            and gets a lot of time and knowledge, many Ph.D. students do not try
            it. It is very cool and valuable for cryptography researchers
            studying cryptography, blockchain, payment systems, security
            dongles, security elements, etc. So, I developed SmartcardPage to
            make smart card testing easy for Ph.D. students and academic
            research labs. A student just needs to have a card reader and open
            this page to communicate with a smart card:

            This is a Java Card Applet implementation as a proof-of-concept of
            my proposed technique to secure the digital sign process in a smart
            card. You can find project details in the attached paper in PDF
            format. I used a proposed method called "one-time scanning" to
            decode DER and TLV format inside the smart card with limited
            resources and performance. My test results demonstrate that this new
            technique works well for a smart card. In this project, you can find
            a decoder for digital certificate, timestamp token, certificate
            revocation list (CLR). Actually, you can use the TLV engine to
            decode every DER-encoded content inside the smart card. You must
            define a template for your content, and then you can decode it in
            the card. There are two different versions of the TLV decoder in the
            source code: TLV and TLV2. The file "TLV.java" is the classic
            version of the TLV decoder, which is fully dynamic and can decode
            all DER-encoded content but is slow in the smart card. The file
            "TLV2.java" is the faster version that uses a one-time scanning
            technique. I used hard-coded 1024 and 2048 RSA keys to test the
            proposed protocol, and if you like real-world keys, you must change
            hard-coded keys with new commands to generate RSA keys on the card.

            ><strong>LedgerNanoS Hack</strong></a
          ><br />
          <p>
            It is a try to reverse engineer the Ledger Nano S that is the best
            existing Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) Hardware Wallet in the
            market. Ledger Live.exe is the desktop application to manage Ledger
            Nano S. It is an Electron application based on NodeJs. It uses the
            "node-hid" library to access HID devices. On the other hand, Ledger
            Nano S has a Secure Element to store the master seed and private
            keys. This secure element is a smart card chip that communicates
            using APDU messages. For reverse engineering, Wireshark is enough to
            monitor USB messages and extract transferred APDUs. Still, if I want
            to modify them and make a Man-In-The-Middle attack, I need to
            develop some hacking code, and this project is that! This code uses
            EasyHook to inject two fake functions into LedgerLive.exe address
            space, including CreateFileA and WriteFile. CreateFileA opens the
            HID device, and WriteFile sends USB messages that include APDU to
            the device. In this hack, I get the HID device handle by injecting
            my code into the CreateFileA function and modify transferred APDUs
            by injecting my code into the WriteFile function. As a result, I
            could intercept APDUs between LedgerLive.exe and Ledger Nano S
            device and alter them as a Man-In-The-Middle attack. Because
            LedgeLive.exe is a NodeJs app, it runs inside that and creates four
            processes. So, "injectorApp" finds all and injects hack code to
            them. Still, only the correct one is hacked by checking the FilePath
            in the CreateFileA call. You can use this project to experiment with
            Ledger Nano S and maybe other USB Hardware Wallets.

            It is a spyware tool for sniffing a user's PIN and altering its
            digital signature in PIV smart card on Microsoft Windows. After
            compiling the project, you must replace Windows original
            'msclmd.dll' with the compiled DLL of this project with the same
            name. To test the DLL, you must have a PIV smart card like
            <a href="https://pivkey.com/" target="_blank">PIV Key</a> or
            <a href="https://www.yubico.com/" target="_blank">YubiKey</a>. Use
            your smart card or token to log in to your Windows or run a program
            that uses your YubiKey or PIV smart card. When you enter your
            token's password (PIN), a popup window displays your PIN, which is
            sniffed from DLL. A hacker can use the same technique to steal your
            YubiKey or PIV smart card password. Obviously, I used C++ and
            low-level Windows operating system functions to develop this
            project.

          <strong>Public Key Appliance (PKA)</strong>
          <br />
          <p>
            I developed Public Key Appliance (PKA) in 2010. At that time,
            running a public key infrastructure was so hard to do. A customer
            needs multiple servers, Hardware Security Modules (HSM), backup
            solutions, database servers, special enterprise applications for
            Certificate Authority, Registration Authority, OCSP Responders, CRL
            Publishers, etc. So, I created an "appliance" that integrates all
            required software and hardware parts in one module. Since I used a
            custom-built Linux operating system with an internal HSM from
            SafeNet, it was secure and fast. We established a startup company
            (PKI Co.) based on this product and sold many of them. I also
            patented PKA in Iran (our target market), winning prizes and startup
            festivals. My co-founders and I created a talented engineering team,
            and I left them in 2016 to immigrate to the US. :-|
